* Keep track of your...
  - Domain names and their expiry dates
  - Whois data
  - Name servers
  - Most important zone data; such as MX, A and AAAA records for www.example.com (requires a zone transfer or manual entry)
  - Maybe we can send notifications every time the serial on the SOA record changes?

* Get notified when something changes or an expiry date (domain or TLS cert) is getting close.

* Auto-test all of your domains with [Zonemaster](https://www.zonemaster.net/)
